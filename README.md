# Complimentary Guide: Working With Julie Miller
**Read Me | Personal User Manual**

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT

Iva Kroghrud gave [an interview to a New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/business/questbacks-lead-strategist-on-his-user-manual.html) journalist where he talked about the complications of joining a new team and navigating personalities and working styles. I agree with his theory that this learning curve can be shortened and simplified by sharing what you know about yourself upfront! I encountered my first ‚ÄúPersonal Read Me‚Äù in 2020, when we were all getting used to a new way of working, and it changed the game. So here‚Äôs one of my own!

### üõú WORKING STYLE

It‚Äôs helpful for me to understand the BIG PICTURE, not just the details that relate to my world. Tell me the business reason and outcomes, the audience, the deadline, and any other context you can think of! 

I believe that any change in culture or process needs to be by example and from the middle out. 

More than anything I thrive in collaborative environments, bouncing ideas off of other people and using all of our resources and talents to think outside of the box. 

### üí™ STRENGTHS

**Ideaphoria:** I have a great capacity for creative thought and imagination. Need a bunch of ideas to solve a problem? I‚Äôm here for you. Will they all be good? Oh no. But there will be a lot of them. 

**Learning New Skills:** My favorite hobby is collecting hobbies. Need someone who can get up to speed on a new program or process overnight? Give me a call. 

### üç≥ WEAKNESSES

**Confrontation:** I don‚Äôt shy away from saying the hard thing or setting boundaries but if your tone or manner can be perceived as aggressive I will remove myself from the situation.  

**Saying No:** I always want to be helpful and tend to say yes when asked to lend a hand. This sometimes means that I don‚Äôt actually have the bandwidth to help. 

### üíñ LIKES

**Feedback:** I am always interested in improving my methods or deliverables. I won‚Äôt take it personally if it‚Äôs constructive and immediately given, especially if there are specific examples. Positive feedback is ALWAYS welcome and appreciated. 

**Explicit Calendar Events:** There is nothing more exciting than seeing a calendar event with everything I need right there in the description. An agenda, links to documents, roles, desired outcomes, even just a copy of the email that kicked off the meeting!! 

### üíî DISLIKES

**Turtles:** Just no. 

**Unnecessary Apologies:** A few minutes late to a meeting? Unsure of the details or an answer? Something outside your control not working? We all have better things to do than apologize, so please don‚Äôt.
